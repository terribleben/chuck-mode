chuck-mode
==========

About
-----

A mode for the `ChucK <http://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/>`_ audio
programming language.  This was written in a fit of rage after
discovering that `the existing mode made it into the Emacs attic
<https://github.com/emacsattic/chuck-mode>`_.  Based upon `CC Mode
<http://cc-mode.sourceforge.net/>`_.

Installation
------------

Install manually or via `Quelpa <https://github.com/quelpa/quelpa>`_
for the time being.

Usage
-----

Just code away.  There are no special features (like, automating
``chuck``) included yet...

Contributing
------------

If you find bugs, have suggestions or any other problems, feel free to
report an issue on the issue tracker or hit me up on IRC, I'm always on
``#emacs``.  Patches are welcome, too, just fork, work on a separate
branch and open a pull request with it.

Alternatives
------------

Use the `Emacs attic version
<https://github.com/emacsattic/chuck-mode>`_ for more highlighted
UGens, ``chuck`` automation support, electric operators and snippets.
