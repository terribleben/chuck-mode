# chuck-mode

This is [wasamasa's major mode for editing ChucK](https://github.com/wasamasa/chuck-mode) with the addition of more of ChucK's built-in classes and keywords. I think it is accurate as of ChucK 1.13.* (chimera).

If you're looking for the one mentioned on [this page](http://wiki.cs.princeton.edu/index.php/ChucKWithEmacs), I believe the most recent variation of that can be found [here](https://github.com/emacsattic/chuck-mode).
